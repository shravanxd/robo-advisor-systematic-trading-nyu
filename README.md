Assignments and Project for Robo Advisors &amp; Systematic Trading course.

This repository primarily serves as a storage space for the assignments and projects I will be working on throughout the semester. I am taking this course in Spring 2025 at NYU Stern School of Business. The course is designed to address a fundamental question: **"Should you trust your money to an AI?"**  

Most of the coursework was originally intended to be completed in Excel. However, given my background in Data Science, I decided to implement the assignments using Jupyter Notebook instead and upload the code here. Since the coursework focuses heavily on building trading strategies, the notebooks I upload can serve as templates for similar strategies. The core logic will already be implemented, and only the data will need to be adjusted accordingly.  

I will continue updating this repository as the course progresses!
